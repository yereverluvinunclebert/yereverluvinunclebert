### Welcome chaps!

This is my repository for some interesting and hopefully useful utilities that have an unusual or different graphical quality from the usual run-of-the-mill stuff. Here you will find functioning code for three main programming environments: firstly, javascript widgets for Konfabulator, also latterly known as the Yahoo Widget Engine; then equivalent jScript code for the similar Xwidget Engine; lastly Visual Basic code desktop widgets and utilities for VB6, creating WoW64 programs for the desktop.

I focus on Steampunk Design, why do I do it?

Well, I personally, can't bear the look and feel of current desktop computing being so locked into a 1980s 'modern' square box paradigm. Current GUIs, deriving mostly from Microsoft's efforts, have a basis in the GUIs we created in the late 80s and early 90s and despite regular 'improvements' those from MS or Apple still haven't moved on much. Do you run XP, Vista, Win 7, 8, 10, 11+? Well, if you do, that means under the skin you are still running NT5 or 6, all basically the same fundamental o/s. The only real differentiator is the GUI that MS foists upon you. Now, in mind a GUI is a GUI and should not be confused with the underlying operating system and due to that disitinction you should really be able to decide which style of GUI you want to run.

A GUI should be independent of the o/s or at the very least the o/s ought to be very easy to theme and to customise as you wish. In the Linux world this holds true however, this just isn't the case with any Microsoft operating system as the default 'look and feel' provided with the current version of the os is really the only thing that really sets it apart from the previous version. Under the bonnet (or the hood), one version is largely the same as another.

You'll see a massive example of this with Metro or Material Design, the UI that comes with Windows 8 & 10. The underlying os is still good old NT6 and operates much in the same way that Win7 does. However, the whole user interface has been modified to try to get you to use live tiles on the desktop as you would on a Windows phone, to make you use 'apps' rather than programs as you would on the desktop. This schizophrenic approach to a desktop o/s is hoisted upon you as Microsoft has no decent tablet-centric o/s and instead are trying to squish Windows onto tablets - it isn't working, look at the death of windows phone and even more recently, the death of Windows on tablets. They are trying to get you to adopt a new GUI so that you conform to the business plan they have in mind for Windows. That business plan is now a failed model but you, the consumer is still suffering for it.

My aim is to help you break out of this corporate mindset and to think of desktop customisation as a natural thing to do, much in the same way that you decorate and design your home, make the desktop your place to live, to work and operate. So, with this in mind, I set out to create a series of wallpapers, widgets and icons for an o/s interface that meets the aims and needs of a small but thoroughly dedicated group of chaps and ladies known as steampunkers. Around the web my alter ego is yereverluvinunclebert, where you find steampunk design I won't be far away.

I have set out my steampunk design skills in this way to demonstrate what I can do graphically, underneath the graphics is a little skill in javascript and some slowly increasing capabilities in VB6. So, whether or not you are a steampunker or a coder yourself, with these widgets, programs and icons you can thoroughly retro-ise your desktop.

Why do I still code in some supposedly obsolete environments? Well, I coded my first desktop widgets in javascript but the most popular engine, Konfabulator, was deprecated by Yahoo in their process of going bust. They bought Konfabulator when they were rich but disposed of it when they were not. I then continued to create widgets for the Xwidget engine and that soon died too. Coding for a dying environment is a bit depressing... so I moved back to VB6, a skillset still retained from the late 1990s/early 2000s. 

Why I am still persisting with VB6 when some think it is a dead language?  Well, it was dead but now VB6 code has an amazing future with a brand new 64 bit, modern-language improvement upgrade on the way, in the form of Wayne Phillip's 100% VB6 compatible TWINBASIC coupled with support for transparent PNG widgets via Olaf Schmidt's Rich Client Cairo graphics framework. I can now create graphically advanced programs and the future for my code is secure.

Some of my projects:

This is SteamyDock, my RocketDock/ObjectDock replacement written in VB6, an unfinished but working project. Needs a rethink to encapsulate certain elements and make the code more streamlined. However, it works and it runs on all my Windows systems.

This is my Steampunk CPU/GPU Thermometer widget using OHM written in javascript for the Yahoo Widget Engine, a basically finished  project that requires some fettling to fix a bug or two. I aim to rewrite this in VB6.  Uses OHM to extract the system motherboard temperatures.

![orrery-desktop](https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/yereverluvinunclebert/assets/2788342/094b58ce-f3d7-4df8-9557-8c648940675e)

This is my Orrery widget using javascript for the Yahoo Widget Engine, a basically finished project that requires some fettling to fix a bug or two that has arisen as time has progressed (as usual for me). An eye candy widget.

![steampunk_clock_calendar_mkii__2_9__rc_by_yereverluvinuncleber-d4l5xny](https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/yereverluvinunclebert/assets/2788342/e91568e6-4a11-4fa0-8eaf-7b2e227c98d6)

This is my very first widget built using Photoshop and using javascript for the Yahoo Widget Engine, a basically finished project that requires some fettling to fix a bug or two that has arisen as time has progressed (as always).

This is my desktop hole widget using javascript for the Yahoo Widget Engine, a finished project.

This is my Panzer Clock widget, initially written using javascript for the Yahoo Widget and Xwidget Engines, each a finished project and now there is a VB6 version also complete.

![panzer-OHMXwidget1440x900](https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/yereverluvinunclebert/assets/2788342/74f2083d-c41f-4f94-8639-fc2a0cf6888f)

This is my Panzer OHM temperature widget, written using javascript for the Yahoo Widget and Xwidget Engines, each a finished project. Uses OHM to extract the system motherboard temperatures.

This is my Volume Control widget, initially written using javascript for the Yahoo Widget then converted to the Xwidget Engine to overcome a Windows change to the sound system, the Xwidget a finished project. There is now a VB6 version whose coding is underway now.

![d5zka9p-7b86c6d7-1b56-4f23-a4ba-9ce9c668356b](https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/yereverluvinunclebert/assets/2788342/629527b8-f144-4d41-9d99-e27d8bbdce42)

If you like nixie tubes then you will like this widget available for the Yahoo and Xwidget engines.

The moon phase widget coupled with the orrery, gives the orrery some function, displaying the phases of the moon.
